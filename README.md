# DevoteMe Discord
*This is the Discord module for the DevoteMe platform*

DevoteMe is a platform that aims to help people connect with the Gospel in a more accessible way. While the Bible is a crucial resource for Christians, the platform acknowledges that there are several other ways to strengthen one's faith and deepen their relationship with God.

Currently, DevoteMe plans to offer several options to help users implement reading, prayer, and connection with God and others. These options may include daily devotionals, prayer, and more. Through these offerings, DevoteMe aims to create a space for individuals to engage with their faith on a regular basis and find support and encouragement from like-minded individuals.

We recognise that technology has significantly changed the way people access information and connect with each other, and it seeks to leverage this shift to bring people closer to God. With its user-friendly platform and diverse offerings, we hope to reach a broad audience and provide a meaningful and accessible way for individuals to connect with the Gospel.
